        <p class="bold">By Youssef El ouazzani</p>
        <h3>The core foundations of data-driven decision making in design</h3>
        <p class="para no-indent">Data-driven decision making involves making informed choices rooted in data analysis rather than relying solely on intuition or personal opinion. In the realm of product design, this approach can draw from various data sources, such as user feedback, market trends, performance metrics, and results from usability testing.</p>
        <p class="para no-indent">For instance, consider how Airbnb effectively leverages user booking patterns and preferences to enhance their listings. By analyzing this data, they can pinpoint the features that attract specific groups, such as families or solo travelers, focusing on aspects like amenities and sleeping arrangements. This insight allows them to customize their offerings, creating a more personalized experience for users. Additionally, the company employs an AI-powered photo tour that intelligently recognizes and categorizes images by room, helping travelers visualize the house layout more clearly.</p>
